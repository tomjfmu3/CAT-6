<p>An estimated 417,000 people died from Tuberculosis in the African region (1.7 million globally) in 2016. Over 25% of TB deaths occur in the African Region. TB bacteria are spread through the air from one person to another. The TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, or sings. People nearby may breathe in these bacteria and become infected. There are vaccines for this illness, but vaccines are not readily common in most of Africa so many go untreated.</p>
